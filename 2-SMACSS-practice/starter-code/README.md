##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I started with the style file and worked my way from top to bottom, moving items from generalized to more specific file separation. Most styles got moved from style.css to base and layout, and then from there, modules were pulled to their separate file.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No, I just worked with the current set-up.
